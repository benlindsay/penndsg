WUDAC and PDSG are partnering to work through Kaggle datasets and [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) courses in small groups for learners of all levels. Graduate students studying data science from the Penn Data Science Group will be leading the groups. Topics will range from Intro to Python to more intermediate-level analysis. All attendees will get free access to DataCamp courses.
